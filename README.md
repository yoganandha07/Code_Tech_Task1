This project uses Linear Regression to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in the Boston area based on various features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, accessibility to highways, and more.

Dataset

Features
crim: Per capita crime rate by town
zn: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
indus: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
chas: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
nox: Nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)

dis: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
rad: Index of accessibility to radial highways
tax: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000
ptratio: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
b: Proportion of Black residents by town
lstat: Percentage of lower-status population
medv: Median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1000s) - target variable
